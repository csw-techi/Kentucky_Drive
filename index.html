                <p>It doesn’t take long to realize why Kentucky is known as “The Bluegrass State” with how richly colored the grass is due to the fertile soil. The region is also renowned for its horse racing history and bourbon-making centers. These things alone make spending time in the area a worthwhile and enjoyable endeavor, but there’s more to Kentucky than initially meets the eye. Its rivers and state parks are chock full of recreational opportunities, and wildlife like deer, turkey, and elk thrive. Get off the well-worn interstate and onto a country road or two-lane highway to forge a more intimate connection with the state, beginning with one of our favorite Kentucky scenic drives.</p>

            <p class="routed"> This scenic drive through various small towns and bourbon country is an ideal way to spend a morning or afternoon and is easily accessible from cities like Louisville or Lexington. Travelers along this way have the opportunity to explore sites of interest to Civil War enthusiasts, such as the Civil War History Museum in Bardstown and the Perryville Battlefield State Historic Site. While in Bardstown, known as “The Bourbon Capital of the World,” sampling an ounce or two at the Maker’s Mark Distillery or Jim Beam’s American Stillhouse is a must.</p>

            <p class="routed"> Passing right through the heart of the Kentucky Bluegrass Region, expect lovely farmland views off this rural two-lane route. Consider touring the Kentucky Horse Park or the Lexington National Cemetery before starting off to get a taste of the racing tradition and Civil War history that shaped the region. Once in Frankfort, Cove Spring Park offers plenty of recreational activities, such as a hike to Hurst Falls, to help unwind from the day.</p>

            <p class="routed"> With at least three essential stops on this route, allow a day to fully savor the sights, beginning with the Kentucky Museum in Bowling Green, the birth place of cake-making legend Duncan Hines. Once in the Green River Valley with sweeping views, pull over to investigate Mammoth Cave State Park, with 400 miles of underground passages charted and far more to explore. Once back in Bowling Green, end the day at the National Corvette Museum right across the street from the assembly plant that makes each and every one of these supercars.</p>
