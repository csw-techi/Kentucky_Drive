# Welcome to Kentucky Drive!

This is my project for Code Louisville Front End Web Development. My page helps people find great driving roads in Kentucky. This page provides some details about the featured route and a link to Google maps.

## Two Media Queries:
@media only screen and (min-width : 768px)

@media only screen and (min-width : 1024px)

## CSS Features:
1. This CSS feature changes the navigation from vertical to horizontal at 768px. 

"A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon."

2. This CSS feature changes the layout from single column to two column using flexbox at 1200px.

"Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop."

## JavaScript Feature:
1. This javascript feature counts "votes" or button clicks and displays the total on the page. 

"Create a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation (calculates something) and displays the result on your page or otherwise uses that value to do something on the site."

"Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code."
